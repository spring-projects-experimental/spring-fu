Spring Fu is an incubator for new Spring features about Kotlin and functional bean registration.
Its main feature is an alternative way of configuring Spring Boot applications with Kotlin DSL and lambdas instead of annotations:
http://repo.spring.io/snapshot/org/springframework/fu/spring-fu-kofu/0.0.3.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/spring-fu-kofu-0.0.3.BUILD-SNAPSHOT-javadoc.jar!/kofu/org.springframework.fu.kofu/application.html[Kofu (for **Ko**tlin and **fu**nctional) configuration].
Other features like https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-fu/tree/master/coroutines[Coroutines] or GraalVM support are also included.

A Java variant called Jafu (for **Ja**va and **fu**nctional) is https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-fu/blob/master/samples/jafu-reactive-minimal/src/main/java/com/sample/JafuApplication.java[also available] (just a POC for now).

It is not intended to be used in production, but rather to incubate and get feedback and contributions
from the community in order to reach a point where its features can be integrated as part of existing
Spring projects like Framework, Boot and Data. The table bellow summarize the status of current features.

|=====

== Getting started

=== Via start.spring.io

 * Create a Spring `2.1.x.RELEASE` project on https://start.spring.io/#!language=kotlin[start.spring.io],
 * Add the `org.springframework.fu:spring-fu-kofu:0.0.3.BUILD-SNAPSHOT` dependency
 * Add the _Reactive Web_ `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-webflux` dependency 
 * Use latest Kotlin `1.3.x`
 * Modify the generated `*Application.kt` file as following:

```kotlin
package com.example

import org.springframework.fu.kofu.application

val app = application {
	// your application here
	server {
		router {
			GET("/") { ok().syncBody("Hello world!") }
		}	
	}
}
fun main() {
	app.run()
}
```

=== Samples

You can also have a look to the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-fu/tree/master/samples/[sample applications].
